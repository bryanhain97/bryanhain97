- 👋 Hi, my name is Bryan I'm from Berlin and 24 years old. I'm trying to become a self taught developer. 

- 👀 I’m interested in programming and computer hardware architecture.

- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on web-development. I started learning how to code in September of 2020 and at the moment i'm working my way through the process of connecting the frontend with the backend. I want to launch a project-website when I got a good understanding of the core concepts of frontend- and backend development (Nov.2021).
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps me build my knowledge around web-development and would love to connect to people of this industry!
